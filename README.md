##3/30/2016: Cognitive Services announced
Announced at **Build 2016**, Microsoft Cognitive Services is a new collection of intelligence and knowledge APIs that enable developers to make their applications more intelligent, engaging and discoverable. It includes intelligent APIs from Bing, the former Project Oxford, and more, that allow systems to see, hear, speak, understand and interpret our needs using natural methods of communication, and knowledge APIs that bring the power of the web to developers.

With Cognitive Services, developers can easily add intelligent features – such as emotion and sentiment detection, vision and speech recognition, knowledge, search and language understanding – into their applications. The collection will continuously improve, adding new APIs and updating existing ones. 

**Emotion API**: Analyze faces to detect a range of feelings and personalize your app's responses.

**Face API**: Detect human faces and compare similar ones, organize people into groups according to visual similarity, and identify previously tagged people in images.
